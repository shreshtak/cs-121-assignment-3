We improved the relevance of results by implementing ranked retrieval using the lnc.ltc scheme for 
tf-idf/cosine similarity scoring with normalization. We also broke ties between cosine similarity scores
with the sum of the query term frequencies in each document. 

We improved the query processing time by constructing our inverted index as separate files based on the starting 
character (alphanumeric only; a-z, 0-9) of tokens. At query time, we would only read from the inverted index 
files for the starting characters of the query tokens. We also calculated document tf-idf scores at indexing time 
instead of at query time, and we implemented champion lists to reduce the number of documents searched and cosine 
scores calculated at query time. Additionally, we used simhash at indexing time to get rid of near-duplicate pages, 
in turn reducing the number of pages to index and search through.
